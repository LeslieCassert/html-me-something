                    <li><strong>Scuba Diving/Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef</strong></li>
                    <img src = "http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-GreatBarrierReef.png?itok=Srtx66fg" alt= "A vibrant picture of corals and fish."/>
                        <p>Traveling has always been an interest of mine. The flying, not so much. At the top of my bucket list is scuba diving or snorkeling in the GBR. As the life in it declines, the possibility of me visiting to a bountiful reef decreases. Over 2,000 species of wildlife take up home at this magnificent reef. The fact that it may be gone in a couple decades is heartbreaking. </p>

                    <li><strong>Dirt Biking in Sand Dunes</strong></li>
                    <img src = "https://www.legendaryspeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shredin-sand-dunes-with-a-dirt-bike-like-a-boss.jpg" alt = "I dirt biker sitting on their bike on top of a sand dune."/>
                        <p>I own two motorcycles. Learned how to ride on dirtbikes. This seems like one of the ultimate adrenaline rushes for me, and so much fun that I may jump up and down of happiness if I am ever able to do it. I've started my motorcycle collection with a KTM and Harley, soon to expand when I have access to a garage!</p>

                <article>
                    <li><strong>Swim with Whales in the Wild</strong></li>
                    <img src ="http://swimmingwithgentlegiants.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_8937.jpg" alt = "A person swimming near a Humpback Whale."/>
                        <p>I think many people would be scared out of jumping into open ocean with giant creatures. I firmly believe whales will not harm you, especially baleen whales, if you have the guts to visit their habitat. </p>

                <article>
                    <li><strong>Walk across the Sydney Bridge</strong></li>
                    <img src = "http://m.sydney.com.au/images/bridge-climb1.jpg" alt = "A picture looking off the bridge over the Sydney Opera House."/>
                        <p>The fact that some people won't do this blows my mind. What better way to get an amazing view of Sydney, plus you are safe and strapped in!</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <li><strong>Climb Mount Huashan</strong></li>
                    <img src = "https://www.updateordie.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/huashan04.jpg" alt = "A picture of the plank pathway on the side of Mount Huashan."/>
                        <p>Even though you are strapped into this one, it is much more adrenaline enducing. Dubbed one of the most dangerous hikes in the world and going 2,000 feet up in the air, this would definitely get my adrenaline going and be a fun adventure.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <li><strong>See the Aurora Borealis</strong></li>
                    <img src = "https://fthmb.tqn.com/p6VQqSvnEOJLq1R516D61CemsP0=/768x0/filters:no_upscale()/166370483-56cb36da5f9b5879cc54103c.jpg" alt = "A picture of the Aurora lights over snow and ice covered water."/>
                        <p>Who wouldn't want so see the beautiful natural phenomenon? Standing in awe under the luminescent colors would definitely be something to remember.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <li><strong>Ride in a Helicopter</strong></li>
                    <img src = "https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/5LMUkcAX25oFx1VPVBfo/hp-2048x1228.jpg/v1/c700x420.jpg" alt = "A helicopter flying."/>
                        <p>Okay, who hasn't thought of what it would be like to ride in a helicopter? To be able to hover in one spot over a single location? The ultimate bucket list for this would be able to drive the helicopter myself, but riding in one will suffice.</p>

                <h2>One I've Crossed Off</h2>
                <img src = "https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1896881_10201701470555584_843538972_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=81229391187a07e55692f897bb9d419a&oe=5B320A86" alt = "A picture of the author playing in a band." />
                <p>Yes, that is me on the far left, yes that is a room full of people. </p>
                <p>I had always wanted to play on a stage in front of a room full of people. After some community college, I decided to take on the rock n' roll life. I lucked out with an amazing group of girls that made it hard to play with anyone else after. I got to play to a full room, a full venue, enough people to pack outside of the venue as well. I won't forget these moments in my life with these girls. I would also do anything to go back to these times.

            <h3>Added Bonus</h3>

            <p>An added bonus to my bucket list is my partner. She encourages me to be happy and is along for the ride. My life is much more enjoyable with her around!</p>
